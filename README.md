# Student Score Prediction

This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting student scores based on various input features. It covers the complete ML workflow, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Deployment-ready code
